## Analysis

In the files `MAOO.R` and `IR_res.R` the above functions are run on the data. There is a parallel and unparallel version of the procedures. The code to create the plots and panel plots can be found in the file `figures.R`. The incidence rate and cumulative incidence got from the analysis can be found in the file `AOO_Results.csv`. It holds the predicted incidence rate and cumulative incidence for all diagnosis and both sexes. The confidence interval for both estimates are given, in addition it also contains the confidence interval for the predictions.  

## Description of input data 

The study looks at individuals who are alive and healthy in Denmark at the begining of 2004 or your 1'st, 5'th or 10'th birthday (Depending on the earliest age of onset of the diagnose) whatever comes later. The study ends at the end of 2021. After cleaning the data, there is a data-set for each diagnose of intrest and it has the following columns.

| Column number | Column name   | Description                                                                        |

## Math

Lets define $A$ as the maximum age of the participants. In this paper we have set $A=8$. Further let $Ã$ denote the median age of onset. 
we wish to compute the mean age of onset for cause $i$ in a competing risk set-up. 
Note that the cumulative incidence function (CIF), in a competing risk set-up, is defined as the Aalen-Johansen estimator:
$$F_i (t) = \int^t_0 S(u) \alpha_i (u) du,$$
where $S(t)$ is the survival function and $\alpha_i (t)$ is the cause-specific hazard for cause $i$ at time $t$. 
Since we are only interested in the cause *Diagnosed*, we will suppress the $i$ in the future. 
The median can be found as $Â := \frac{F (A)}{2}$. The idea is then to transform the CIF to a probability; 
therefore, we divide the the CIF with $F(A)$, this is then subtracted from 1, s.t.
$$G(t) = 1 - \frac{F(t)}{F(A)} .$$
The mean age of onset can then be computed as 
$$\mu = \int^A_0 G(t) dt = \int^A_0 1 -  \frac{F(t)}{F(A)}  dt = A - \frac{1}{F(A)} \int^A_0 F(t) dt.$$
It can be seen as a restricted mean age of onset.
